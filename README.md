# What is it? Tic-tac-toe game
The goal is to create the popular tic-tac-toe game using JS framework React in the client side and JS in the server side.<br/>
You can find the back-end project here https://github.com/aloisio-costa/Tic-Tac-Toe-API <br/>
The program runs fine without the need of the API running. The API is simple used to save the total game score. 

### The game UI

### How it works?
- In the left bottom corner, it shows whose player turn it is
- Players can click in which square they wish to play and "Player Turn" change after every play
- The game stops after finding a winner or the game ends up in a draw. This is also shown in the bottom left side
- On the bottom right side, you can reset the game at any point 
- The score is updated after every win. (You need the API running for this to happen)

# What did I use?
- React hooks and functional components
